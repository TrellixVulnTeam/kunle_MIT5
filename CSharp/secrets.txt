Create a Django app where registered users can post and like secrets.

Login and registration system. Validations apply.
Users can post secrets, delete secrets that they posted, and like secrets posted by others.
On the index page, display the 5 or 10 most recent secrets. Also include a "Most Popular" page, which shows all secrets, sorted by number of likes (most likes is first).
On both index and "Most Popular" page, show how many likes the secrets has received, a link to like that secret if the user hasn't already, and--if the logged-in user posted this secret--an option to delete. Also show when the secret was posted.
Secrets are anonymous--never display the name or E-mail of the person who posted the secret.
